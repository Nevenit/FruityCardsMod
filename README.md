# FruityCardsMod

**FruityCardsMod** is a simple Minecraft mod for the [fruitservers.net](https://fruitservers.net/) Skyblock server that highlights collectible cards in your inventory and in the world, making them easier to spot and track.
The cards automatically opens the /listcards menu and checks which cards are active for the week. This only happens the first time the skyblock server is joined after restarting the game.
